# Methodological Plan (Updated)

## Research Topic
New business models in SMB software development business

## Data
Public sources (company websites, blogs, job postings, press releases, procurement notices, media articles, investor presentations, GitHub/Docs)

## Objective
To create a typology and analysis of new business models in Finnish software development companies.

### 1. Research Design
- **Strategy:** Multiple-case study.
- **Sample criteria:**
  - Companies are members of Software Finland ry.
  - Headcount ≤ 100 (filtered via membership registry and YTJ/LinkedIn data).
  - Select 20–25 companies representing different business models (consulting, SaaS, hybrid, niche strategies).
- **Unit of analysis:** Individual company, coded by business model features.

### 2. Data Collection
#### 2.1 Sources
Only public sources are used:
- Official company websites (front page, services/products, blog, pricing, careers)
- Press releases and news from company or media sites
- Public job postings (LinkedIn, Oikotie, Duunitori)
- Official and registry sources (PRH/YTJ, Hilma procurement notices)
- Investor presentations (if the company is in a VC portfolio)
- GitHub/Docs if the company publishes open code or documentation

#### 2.2 Search Process
- List Software Finland ry members with headcount ≤100
- For each company, perform 10–15 systematic searches (see query diary model)
- Save 5–10 relevant sources per company (URL, HTML/PDF, hash)
- Document all searches in a query diary (query, date, search engine)

### 3. Evidence Extraction and Coding
- Extract 3–6 quotes (≤280 characters) from each source describing the business model
- Use predefined model categories (SaaS/Product, Hybrid, Productized services, Venture studio, etc.)
- Scales: ProductizationLevel (0–3), RiskSharingLevel (0–3), EvidenceStrength (1–5), AnalystConfidence (1–5)

### 4. Quality Assurance
- Each claim is linked to a public source
- At least 10% of rows are manually checked against the source
- Audit trail: all HTML/PDF, hashes, and prompts are saved
- CSVs and memos in version control (e.g., Git)

### 5. Analysis
- Company-level analysis: main model, classification, key differentiators
- Cross-case analysis: model frequency, differences
- Assessment of copyability (RBV) and value creation mechanisms (speed, quality, cost savings, risk transfer)

### 6. Reporting
- Tables (company × model category × scales)
- Visualizations (scatter: productization level vs. recurring revenue; radar: copyability factors)
- Case descriptions (½–1 page/company)
- Typology: new classification of SMB software business models

### 7. Replicability
- Query diary (queries, URLs, dates) published as appendix
- All raw sources (HTML/PDF) and CSVs are saved
- AI's role is documented (only summarization and classification from provided text)

### 8. Ethical Considerations
- Only public sources are used
- No personal data is collected
- AI use is transparent and documented
